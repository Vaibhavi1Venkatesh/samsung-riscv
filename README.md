# samsung-riscv
 Welcome to the Samsung RISC-V  repository. This repository contains my work for the first task of the program. The task involves setting up and using the RISC-V toolchain to compile and run simple programs, as well as documenting the process.

# Samsung RISC-V Task 1

This repository contains the work for Tasks of the RISC-V Talent Development Program.

## Contents
- `task1`: RISC-V based screenshots.

### Disassembly Output

# Samsung RISC-V Task 2

This repository contains a simple RISC-V program to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to a given limit. It includes source code, scripts for compilation and execution, and documentation for setting up and using the RISC-V toolchain and Spike simulator.By using "Ofast"
